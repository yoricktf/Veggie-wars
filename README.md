[# Veggie Wars](https://yoricktf.github.io/Veggie-wars/)
A simple game I built in a week using DOM Manipulation. The idea is to get as much money as possible in the 10 days by buying and selling vegetables. The price fluctuates randomly everytime you travel to a new location.

Its based on an old MS-DOS game called DopeWars, or DrugWars.
